List of things to do:

- Remake JS for tables so that I can invoke just one function to create a table that is not actually a table, but a div that can be resized in CSS. Fully responsive off one function. Will make the table section accessing with APIs easier.
  -Need to create a function that takes one argument, the array, and for the first six objects I create a container with the date, venue and location tags.
