List of things to do:

- Understand promises better so I know how to deal with them
  -why is it pending?
  -how do I access the keyvalues for table? Won't want id, but having trouble accessing all but that

- Figure out the posts for the comment section and try to finish that today

- Remake JS for tables so that I can invoke just one function to create a table that is not actually a table, but a div that can be resized in CSS. Fully responsive off one function. Will make the table section accessing with APIs easier.
